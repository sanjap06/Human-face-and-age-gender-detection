# Human-face-and-age-gender-detection

Project Summary:

This project uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect human faces in real-time and predict their age, gender, and identity. It is useful for applications like smart surveillance, access control, and demographic analysis.

Technologies Used:

Languages: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Dlib, NumPy

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code


Key Features:

1. Face Detection:
Detects human faces from webcam or image input using Haar cascades or a deep learning model (e.g., SSD/MTCNN).


2. Age Prediction:
Predicts age range using a pre-trained CNN model trained on datasets like IMDB-WIKI or Adience.


3. Gender Prediction:
Classifies gender (Male/Female) based on facial features.


4. Face Recognition:
Recognizes and labels known individuals using face embeddings (like FaceNet or Dlib's face recognition model).



Workflow:

1. Capture face from webcam/image


2. Preprocess the face image


3. Feed into trained models for:

Age prediction

Gender prediction

Identity recognition



4. Display results with bounding box and labels on the screen



Challenges Faced:

Handling low-light or blurred images

Improving accuracy of age prediction

Collecting diverse face data for training/validation


Outcome:

Achieved good accuracy in age and gender classification

Successfully recognized known faces with a good match rate

Learned practical skills in computer vision, CNNs, and real-time image processing
